      <h3>Developmental Learning</h3>
     <p>To better understand how students develop their ideas of vocation and purpose throughout their college experience Pathways to Purpose gathered a group of 8 faculty and staff members to assess and rate a collection of 150 essays pulled from student ePortfolios. 50 essays from each level were pulled at random from a collection of over 500 ePortfolios. Students are asked to respond to prompts at three points along their undergraduate experience: during the fall of their first year, after completing an experiential learning course or project during their sophomore or junior year, and as part of a reflection during their final year. In order to rate the responses to each prompt, assessors were normed on the <a href="http://pathways.shc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/VocationalDiscernmentRubric.pdf">Pathways to Purpose Rubric</a> and each essay was rated by 3 different individuals with a reliability rating over .8 for all learning outcomes.</p>

    <p>Sophomore students, faculty, and staff gathered during the first week of classes in the fall for a semi-formal dinner. Vocation and vocational discernment were introduced to the sophomores at the first annual Sophomore Class Dinner. Faculty, staff, and students were encouraged to meet new people and interact on topics of values, goals, and community. This gave students an opportunity to see their sophomore year as an important moment in time where they could really start to consider their place in the world and what it means to have a vocation or a calling.</p>

This report doesn't cover the vastness and detail of the effort, reflection, and activities that make Spring Hill College a place of vocational discernment. The work of the Quality Enhancement Plan extends well beyond the work of Pathways to Purpose as faculty and staff across campus integrate topics of purpose and vocation in their courses, their programs, and their daily conversations with our students. We aim to continue to provide experiences that give students opportunities to discover their unique service to the world.</p><br>
